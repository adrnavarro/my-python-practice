# Copilot Instructions

These are basic rules for using GitHub Copilot in this repository:

1. Use clear, descriptive commit messages for all changes.
2. Prefer readable, well-documented code over clever but obscure solutions.
3. Follow PEP8 style guidelines for Python code.
4. Add type hints to functions and methods where possible.
5. Write tests for new features and bug fixes in the `src/tests/` directory.
6. Do not commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data.
7. Use comments to explain non-obvious logic or design decisions.
8. Keep dependencies up to date in `requirements.txt`.
9. Review Copilot suggestions for correctness and security before accepting.
10. Ask for help or clarification if Copilot's output is unclear or incorrect.

Feel free to update these instructions as the project evolves.
