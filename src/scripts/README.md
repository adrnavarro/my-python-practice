# Scripts

This directory contains standalone Python scripts.

## Guidelines

- Scripts should be executable and perform a specific task
- Include a shebang line: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Add proper argument parsing for command-line scripts
- Include usage documentation in docstrings or comments

## Example

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Script description here.
"""

def main():
    # Script logic here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
