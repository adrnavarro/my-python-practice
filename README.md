## Getting Started

### Modules
Place reusable Python modules in `src/modules/`. These are meant to be imported and used by other code.

### Scripts
Place executable Python scripts in `src/scripts/`. These are standalone programs that can be run directly.

### Tests
Place all test files in `src/tests/`. Follow the naming convention `test_*.py` for test files.

## Contributing

This is a personal practice repository, but feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements!
